# Session Handoff — where we left off

_Last updated: 2026-09-21 (JobSignal Phase 1). This file is the running memory
between Claude Code sessions (the web container clones fresh each time). CLAUDE.md points here._

## TL;DR of current state

- **NEW (2026-09-21): `/jobs/` — PaddySpeaks JobSignal, Phase 1.** A job
  aggregator whose whole proposition is *jobs that still exist*. Full design in
  **`docs/JOBSIGNAL.md`**; how to run it in **`jobsignal/README.md`**; the
  non-negotiable rules are now summarised at the top of `CLAUDE.md`.
  - **It ships with an EMPTY board, deliberately.** Every published job must be
    backed by a currently reachable employer source, so there are no samples and
    no seeds — same rule as testimonials. `jobs/data/*.json` are committed empty
    and the first cron run fills them. **Do not "fix" the empty state by adding
    example jobs.** The pages already render an honest empty state.
  - **The container this was built in cannot reach ATS hosts** (the environment's
    network policy 403s `boards-api.greenhouse.io` et al at the proxy), so no
    live ingestion has ever run. The 27 employer slugs marked `verified: true`
    in `jobsignal/sources.json` are the ones already in production use via
    `interview/scripts/ats_boards.json`; the 12 marked `verified: false` are
    **unproven** and the first CI run is what confirms or quarantines them.
    Check `jobs/data/health.json` after that run and prune what failed.
  - **The one rule everything else protects: `first_seen_at` is written once
    per job id and never updated.** `jobs/data/history.json` is the ledger that
    carries it across runs; `jobs/data/archive/<YYYY>.json` keeps closed roles
    permanently so a repost years later still finds its lineage. Deleting either
    file silently resets every age on the board.
  - **A repost is a new spell on an existing lineage, never a new role.** The
    card says `REPOSTED` instead of a freshness band and confidence is capped at
    MEDIUM (two or more reposts → CAUTION). This was caught by actually running
    the close/repost cycle: the honest age calculation on a fresh requisition
    really does say "JUST POSTED", which is exactly the headline the brief
    forbids — hence the explicit label.
  - **Everything derived is computed in Python and shipped as data.** Confidence,
    signals, freshness, age, repost counts. `jobs/js/` formats and filters and
    decides nothing — a deliberate reaction to the `forms.js` / `ps-forms.js`
    drift trap. If you add a judgement, add it in `jobsignal/pipeline/`.
  - **`python3 -m jobsignal.tests.test_pipeline`** — 47 tests, no network. It
    runs on every PR (Validate Content) and again before each ingest. It also
    guards product rules that live across files: no "Easy Apply" anywhere, no
    `innerHTML` in `jobs/js/`, no aggregator hostnames in the pipeline, no
    hardcoded statistic in the markup, no seeded job in `index.json`.
  - **Pages:** `/jobs/`, `/jobs/search/`, `/jobs/job/?id=`, `/jobs/company/?c=`,
    `/jobs/saved/`, `/jobs/alerts/`, `/jobs/methodology/`, `/jobs/health/`
    (noindex). Query-string routing because GitHub Pages has no rewrites — a
    file per job would mean tens of thousands of files rewritten every 4 hours.
  - **Saved jobs and alerts are `localStorage` only.** No account, no email
    collected, nothing sent to the Worker. Phase 2 adds the `/api/jobs/report`
    route and email alerts through the existing Resend wiring.
  - **Not yet built (Phase 2+):** the reporting endpoint (the button currently
    routes to `/contact/` prefilled), email alert delivery, admin *actions*
    (the health console is read-only), Workday/Jobvite/iCIMS/BambooHR adapters,
    and the D1-backed search that replaces the static index past ~25k roles.
  - Homepage change was **one line** — a nav link beside Interview Studio. No
    deck card, so no filter counts moved.

- **NEW (2026-09-18): `/articles/ai-is-looking-for-you.html`** — an interactive
  story about how professional discovery is changing when the reader is an agent.
  Self-contained HTML, no build step, no external JS. Category `ai`; cards added
  by hand to `index.html` (sidebar + deck), counts bumped to All 149 / AI 14.
  - **Four interactive pieces, all vanilla JS in one IIFE at the bottom of the
    file:** a persona scan (§2), the portfolio title swap (§4), the five-signal
    fingerprint (§5), and the "ask the machine" retriever (§8). No network calls —
    everything runs in the browser on six fictional profiles.
  - **The §8 matcher is deliberately honest and should stay that way.** It matches
    query terms against each profile's `ev` (things the profile *evidences*) and
    `kw` (things it merely *mentions*), then reports CLEAR / POSSIBLE / UNCLEAR.
    **Never add a numeric score** — the whole piece argues against 92-out-of-100
    theatre. The preset briefs are tuned so the flagship one returns
    Devika (clear) / Noor (possible) / Arun (unclear); if you change `VOCAB` or a
    profile's `ev` list, re-check all five presets.
  - **SVG entities must be numeric or literal.** `validate_content.py` parses each
    inline `<svg>` as XML, so `&ldquo;` / `&eacute;` inside an SVG fail the build.
    Use the character itself.
  - **Images are rendered, not drawn:** `share-card.png` (1200×630) and
    `poster.png` (900×1100) were produced by screenshotting a small HTML card in
    headless Chromium. Note the headless quirk — the CSS viewport is
    `--window-size` height minus 87px — so the card was rendered taller and the
    PNG cropped with a pure-Python zlib crop.

- **NEW (2026-09-18): `/abhirami-andhadhi/` is now a layered interpretation, not
  a lyrics page.** Same URL, same top bar / header / footer / tokens as the other
  sacred-text pages. What changed is everything below the header.
  - **`data.js` is the verified Tamil and is NEVER edited.** All interpretation
    lives in a new sibling, **`enrichment.js`**, keyed by verse number. If you
    add verses, add them there. Do not "fix" Tamil in `data.js` from memory —
    if sources disagree, flag the variant in that verse's `sourceNotes`.
  - **17 of 102 entries are interpreted** (Kaappu, 1–7, 10, 24, 25, 54, 66, 69,
    75, 87, Nool Payan). The rest render Tamil + transliteration + the inherited
    meaning. The structure is deliberately reusable: fill in more verses using
    the same object shape, and the navigator, filters, search, garland map and
    PDF all pick them up with no code change.
  - **Three levels of claim are kept apart and must stay apart:** TEXT (what
    Bhattar's Tamil says) / TRADITION (what later devotional practice does with
    it) / READING (symbolic, psychological, Sri Vidya). Provenance chips render
    this on every card. Never collapse them — "Bhattar says chanting verse 24
    cures disease" is exactly the sentence this architecture exists to prevent.
  - **No medical or financial guarantees, ever.** Verse 24 is "traditionally
    associated with relief from illness", supported by its own words
    (பிணிக்கு மருந்தே); verse 54 is about the humiliation of having to ask, not
    about debts being cancelled. Keep that register.
  - **Word splits are semantic, not whitespace.** Sandhi, compounds and poetic
    contractions are opened out (உலகேழும் → உலகு + ஏழும்), double meanings are
    listed, and `lemma: true` marks a gloss entry that is a word *note* rather
    than a chunk of the line.
  - **Guardrail: `node .github/scripts/validate_abhirami.js`**, wired into the
    Validate Content workflow. It fails if a word of the source Tamil is dropped
    from a breakdown, if a cited Lalitha name does not exist or its
    transliteration does not match `lalitha-sahasranama/data.js`, or if the
    navigator points at an uninterpreted verse. It caught a real omission
    (அபிராமி missing from verse 1) and three word-level errors during the build.
    Run it before pushing changes to either page.
  - **The Lalitha page now has deep-link anchors.** `id="name-N"` on every name
    row plus `#name-N` hash handling, so `/lalitha-sahasranama/#name-551` opens
    the 1000 Names view, scrolls to the name and highlights it. 67 cross-links
    on the Abhirami page depend on this — don't remove it.
  - **KNOWN DATA ISSUE, pre-existing and not yet fixed.** The inherited English
    `meaning` values in `abhirami-andhadhi/data.js` are **misaligned with the
    Tamil for a substantial number of verses** — they appear to have been
    shuffled at some point. Verified examples: verse 10's Tamil is "standing,
    sitting, lying, walking I think of You" but its meaning describes a fortified
    city; verse 24's Tamil is the gem/medicine verse but its meaning is about
    Siva's three eyes; verses 12, 25, 54 and 100 are likewise wrong. The 17
    interpreted verses carry corrected renderings built from their word
    breakdowns. Everything else now shows a "working translation — under review"
    label instead of being presented as settled. **The fix is to work through the
    remaining verses in `enrichment.js`, not to re-shuffle `data.js`.**
  - Minor: `refresh_sitemap_lastmod.py` maps a directory URL only to its
    `index.html`, so a change confined to a page's `app.js`/`style.css` (as with
    the Lalitha anchors) does not move that entry's `lastmod`.

- **NEW (2026-09-14, later the same day): all four Data Lab dashboards are now
  LIGHT-THEMED.** Paddy asked for lighter backgrounds — the dark demos were
  causing eye strain. `/lakehouse/`, `/ai-command-center/`,
  `/revenue-intelligence/` and `/resilience-war-room/` all moved from near-black
  grounds to soft off-white ones. **Do not "restore" the dark theme.**
  - **Off-white, not pure white.** Grounds are ~`#eef0f7` with white panels;
    pure `#fff` behind everything is its own kind of harsh.
  - **Each demo keeps its hue identity** (violet / emerald / amber / orange) and
    its own type stack. They are still meant to look like four products.
  - **Accents were darkened, not just reused.** `#34d399` on white is ~3:1 and
    unreadable at 10px. Every accent has a darker twin (e.g. mint
    `#34d399` → `#0a7f57`, amber `#ffb01f` → `#935c00`, cyan `#22d3ee` →
    `#087a97`). If you add a colour, check it against the ground before shipping.
  - **Three classes of colour had to move, and only the first is obvious:**
    (1) the `:root` tokens; (2) hard-coded hexes in Chart.js configs and inline
    SVG, which no token swap reaches; (3) `rgba(255,255,255,.04)` hairlines and
    `rgba(0,0,0,.6)` shadows, which become invisible and filthy respectively on
    a light ground. A theme swap that only does (1) looks broken.
  - **Contrast is audited, not eyeballed.** `scratchpad/contrast.mjs` walks every
    tab and computes the real ratio of every text node against its resolved
    background. It cannot see `background-image`, so white text on a gradient
    (the header orbs, the active `QTD` chip) reports as a false positive —
    verify those with a screenshot rather than "fixing" them.
  - **The homepage Data Lab card covers were relit too**, so the preview matches
    the dashboard you land on.
  - **Label fix shipped alongside:** war-room incidents used to read
    "$1.38B exposed", which contradicted the $842M "revenue exposed" KPI. That
    figure is the revenue *behind* the affected line, so it now reads
    "behind it". Same class of error as the map's "in scope" fix.

- **NEW (2026-09-14): three executive demo dashboards ship alongside `/lakehouse/`.**
  `/ai-command-center/`, `/revenue-intelligence/` and `/resilience-war-room/` —
  each a single self-contained HTML file, seven tabs, Chart.js from jsdelivr,
  `lib/ps.js` + tracking pixel, same shape as the lakehouse demo. They are
  deliberately **not** MDM/data-quality dashboards: the story is executive
  decision-making (AI value realization, margin protection, resilience).
  - **They are visually distinct from each other on purpose** — different
    palettes, type stacks (Inter/JetBrains, IBM Plex, Barlow/Roboto Mono),
    and different signature components (agent fleet cards; a KPI ticker rail
    and a CSS margin waterfall; an SVG world map and a vendor cascade graph).
    Do not "harmonise" them into one design system; the point of three demos
    is that they do not look like one demo shown three times.
  - **Chart.js config gotcha, found the hard way.** `responsive`,
    `maintainAspectRatio`, `plugins` and `scales` must sit under `options`, not
    at the config root. Put at the root they are silently ignored — the tell is
    canvases rendering at a 2:1 aspect ratio instead of filling their panel, and
    axis/grid styling reverting to Chart.js light-theme defaults. All three
    demos nest a shared `base = { options: {...} }` and deep-merge the per-chart
    config into it.
  - **`var(--x)` cannot be concatenated with an alpha suffix.** `var(--mint)99`
    is not a colour, so any gradient built in JS resolves to hex first (see the
    `HEX`/`hex()` helper in the AI demo). This bug renders progress bars
    invisible rather than throwing, so it survives a console check.
  - **The numbers reconcile, and are meant to stay that way.** In the revenue
    demo the funnel, the margin waterfall, the product table and the action list
    all tie to $412.6M booked / $23.8M recoverable / $18.6M actionable. In the AI
    demo the simulator reproduces the $57.9M net baseline exactly when every
    input is at plan (97,710 hrs/qtr × 4 × $123.6 + $23.1M − $8.9M − $4.6M).
    If you change a figure, change its siblings.
  - **Filters reslice, they do not scale rates.** Money-like measures scale with
    the selected slice; percentages, confidence and uptime are re-sliced only.
    A margin percentage does not fall because you looked at one region.
  - **CDN is blocked in the web container** (`cdn.jsdelivr.net` returns 403 at
    the proxy), so Chart.js never loads in-sandbox. To verify charts locally,
    `npm i chart.js` and route `**/cdn.jsdelivr.net/**` to the local UMD build
    in Playwright. All three demos guard on `typeof Chart === 'undefined'` and
    degrade to chartless panels rather than throwing.
  - **`index.html` was hand-edited, not regenerated** (per CLAUDE.md). The Data
    Lab grid is now four cards in a 2×2 `auto-fit` layout; the lakehouse card was
    restyled to match but its copy is unchanged. `sitemap.xml` gained three
    entries grouped with `/lakehouse/`.

- **NEW (2026-09-10): every published HTML page now carries a server-side
  tracking pixel.** PR #820, merged as `c21a15a`. A 1×1 `img` pointing at
  `https://ps.paddyspeaks.com/api/px.gif` (`alt=""`, `width=1`, `height=1`,
  `style="position:absolute;opacity:0"`, `loading="eager"`) sits immediately
  before the closing `body` tag, so pageviews are counted **without depending on
  JS** — it complements `lib/ps.js`, it does not replace it.
  - **308 pages of 1299 candidates.** Skipped: top-level `analytics/` and
    `scripts/` (10 files, tooling not pages) and **991 files with no closing
    `body` tag** — HTML fragments, 989 of them under
    `interview/data/enrichments/`, plus `tools/share-cards/` and
    `interview.app/partials/nav.html`.
  - **`interview.app/analytics/index.html` IS pixelled.** Despite the directory
    name it is a public content page (own canonical URL, `robots: index,follow`,
    OG tags). Only the *top-level* `analytics/` is Worker tooling. Don't "fix"
    this by excluding it.
  - **`Paddy_Iyer_Resume.html` is a single-line document** (a Google Docs
    export). Its tag is spliced inline rather than put on its own line. Any
    script that inserts before `</body>` must handle this case — treating the
    text before the tag as "indentation" duplicates the entire file.
  - **Each page passes its own path as `?p=`, and it has to.** The pixel is on
    `ps.paddyspeaks.com`, a *different origin* to the site, so browsers'
    default `strict-origin-when-cross-origin` policy strips the path from
    `Referer` and sends only the origin — deriving the page from `Referer`
    alone put **every** hit on `/`. `pixelPage()` in `worker.js` prefers `?p=`
    and keeps `Referer` as the fallback for HTML cached before this shipped.
    `?p=` is attacker-controllable, so it is validated (must start with a
    single `/`, no control characters, ≤512 chars, query/fragment stripped) —
    see the `pixelPage` cases in `analytics/tests/run.mjs`.
  - **The `?p=` value is `location.pathname`, deliberately — not the canonical
    URL.** `lib/ps.js` records `page_views.page` from `location.pathname`, so
    matching it keeps the two tables comparable. 14 legacy pages canonicalise
    to a *different* preferred URL (e.g. `articles/ai-bill-arrives.html` →
    `.../your-ai-is-brilliant-then-the-bill-arrives.html`); using canonical
    would have mis-filed real visits onto pages nobody loaded.
  - **`serverTopPages` is computed by the API but not rendered anywhere** in
    `analytics/index.html` — only the `serverHits` total and the "% invisible"
    tile are. Per-page server numbers are correct in D1 but currently invisible
    in the dashboard.
  - **The endpoint itself was never exercised end-to-end** from the container
    (the sandbox blocks `*.workers.dev`, and calling the real pixel would write
    junk rows into live analytics). Worth confirming once that hits actually
    land in D1.
  - **`sitemap.xml` was deliberately NOT touched.** Running
    `refresh_sitemap_lastmod.py` would have stamped today's date on nearly every
    page for a change that is invisible to readers — precisely the "dates
    reliably wrong" failure the script's own docs warn about. A tracking pixel
    is not a recrawl signal.

- **THIRD PASS (2026-09-10): "The Job Posting Is Not the Job" gained four
  commissioned photographs and three deliberate "pattern interrupts".** Paddy
  scored the second pass at content 9, readability 8.5, visual storytelling 8.5,
  and asked for a surgical cleanup rather than another rewrite — plus 2–3 visual
  surprises, because 15–20 screens of cream/charcoal/teal had become predictable.
  - **FOUR PHOTOGRAPHS, uploaded by Paddy to `images/` as `img1 -jobsearch.png`
    … `img4 jobsearch.png`** (note the space in filenames). Converted to WebP
    (q82, max width 1600) and renamed into
    `images/articles/the-job-posting-is-not-the-job/`:
    `desk-tracker` (hero), `recruiter-queue` (Scene 01), `hiring-map-glass`
    (Scene 04), `pipeline-kanban` (Scene 11). **7.32 MB of PNG → 395 KB of
    WebP.** The source PNGs were removed from the tree; they live in git
    history at **`4586ad5`**. Regenerate with Pillow.
  - **The photo/diagram division of labour is deliberate: photographs carry the
    visceral beat, SVGs do the analytical work.** `img2` is especially lucky —
    it is literally a hand-drawn hiring map on glass, so it now opens Scene 04
    and the precise SVG org chart follows it. Do not swap these roles.
  - **THE THREE PATTERN INTERRUPTS** (each a departure from the editorial grid):
    1. **Scene 03 is now a detective evidence board.** Graph-paper ground via an
       SVG `<pattern>`, the posting pinned at `rotate(-1.4deg)`, hand-drawn
       double-stroke ellipses and curved arrows, Caveat annotations in red /
       green / amber: *47 days old? · req id ✓ · who is Dana?* **Left-margin
       annotations must end before x=344** — that is the card's left edge, and
       two of them overlapped it before being reflowed.
    2. **Scene 07's bad message is now a messaging-UI mock** (`.dmwrap` / `.dm`)
       with a rotated `DELETED IN 4.2 SECONDS` stamp absolutely positioned over
       it. Deliberately generic — no LinkedIn logo or brand blue, fictional
       sender — so it illustrates rather than impersonates. Keep it that way.
    3. **Scene 10 opens on a dark band with a perspective tunnel**, the
       application at the wide mouth and five follow-ups shrinking and reddening
       as they recede (*Following up → Circling back → Just bubbling this up →
       Bump → HELLO???*), with a teal light at day 39. The old "annoying"
       column was **deleted**, not kept — the tunnel carries that joke now, and
       keeping both was the repetition Paddy warned about.
  - **Six surgical corrections from the review:** the cover said 12 scenes and
    there are 13; "Scene 03" was announced twice (kept the stronger
    *four-minute autopsy*); the queue diagram's `244` and recruiter panel are
    now dominant with the micro-annotations promoted into a legible three-card
    `.statrow`; the second full-bleed statement's payoff line went from an 11px
    `.attrib` to a `clamp(21px,3.6vw,40px)` `.substatement`; every scenario row
    is now ~2 sentences with the remainder behind a nested `<details>`; and the
    finale ends on a dedicated `.knockout` section where *"the right 10 people"*
    owns the screen at up to 98px.
  - Core prose is **2,998 words** with **3,090 behind expandables** — the
    trimming moved words into progressive disclosure rather than deleting them.
    Document height 28,864px (was 24,022 before the photos; 85,970 in the
    original essay).
  - Share card and index cards were **not** changed. A photo-led OG image
    (`desk-tracker`) is the obvious upgrade if social performance matters —
    offered to Paddy, not done unasked.

- **REBUILT (2026-09-10, second pass): "The Job Posting Is Not the Job" was
  rewritten from scratch as a VISUAL FIELD GUIDE, replacing the 24k-word essay
  at the same slug and URL.** Paddy's brief: "not a traditional long-form
  article" — a premium, scannable editorial web experience where **the graphics
  ARE the article** and prose only connects them.
  - **Numbers that define the format.** Core prose **3,047 words** (brief asked
    for 2,500–3,500); **2,529 more words behind `<details>` expandables**;
    document height **24,022px, down from 85,970px**. Read time 62 min → **13
    min**. Ten inline SVGs across **13 numbered scenes** plus a finale.
  - **The previous 24k-word version is NOT deleted — it is in git history**
    (merged in PR #815, commit `55b0aef`). If a "full field manual" companion
    is ever wanted, recover it from there rather than rewriting.
  - **Design identity:** bone `#FAF7F1` / charcoal `#191C20` / one teal accent
    `#12657E` / muted go-hold-stop. Newsreader display, IBM Plex Sans + Mono,
    **Caveat for hand-drawn annotations**. Scene rhythm is deliberate: `.scene`
    → `.statement` (a single sentence owning a dark full-bleed screen) → `.scene--alt`.
  - **THE TRAP THAT BIT TWICE — reveal-on-scroll must never gate content.**
    `.rv{opacity:0}` hid every diagram when the observer script was not yet
    written. Fixed by scoping to `.js .rv{opacity:0}`, where an inline script
    right after `<body>` sets the `js` class. **No-JS now renders everything.**
    Keep it that way; do not un-scope those rules.
  - **Mobile diagrams need `.figscroll svg{min-width:880px}` under 900px.**
    Omitted it in this rewrite and every diagram silently shrank to 354px at
    phone width, turning labels into ~4px mush. The `<figcaption>` and
    `.fighint` stay OUTSIDE `.figscroll` so they don't pan.
  - **SVG gotchas re-confirmed:** HTML named entities (`&mdash;`, `&rarr;`, …)
    are *undefined in XML* and break the CI validator — use literal characters
    inside `<svg>`. There is a scripted entity-cleaning pass in the session log
    worth reusing. Long `<text>` silently overruns its `<rect>`; SVG has no
    wrapping, so split lines and grow the rect *and* the viewBox.
  - **Interactive bits:** an 8-way scenario tab selector (`.pick` buttons +
    `role="tabpanel"`, `s1` open, `s2`–`s8` `hidden`) and expandable
    "See the data / Show the other five / Use the full checklist" modules. All
    verified: 8 tabs ↔ 8 panels, no duplicate ids, no broken in-page anchors.
  - **Evidence discipline survived the shrink.** Fourteen numbered sources, all
    fourteen cited inline, `Evidence`/`Practice`/`Contested` badges retained,
    and a small "How we know" expandable sits in the hero instead of a
    methodology preamble. Both debunkings kept: the "80% of jobs are never
    advertised" myth and "75% of résumés are rejected by ATS".
  - Share card and `poster.webp` were **not** regenerated — the existing card
    already shows the struck-through old model above the eight-step 2026 model,
    which is exactly Scene 0. `tools/share-cards/` holds the regeneration source.

- **NEW (2026-09-10): "The Job Posting Is Not the Job" published —
  `articles/the-job-posting-is-not-the-job.html`** (category `personality`,
  ~23,900 words, 62 min, six inline SVG diagrams). A field manual for the 2026
  job market. Scope deliberately **stops at the foot in the door** — recruiter
  screen, hiring-manager call, interview invite. Interview prep, behavioural
  questions and salary negotiation are explicitly out of scope and flagged in
  the closing panel as "the next article." **Keep that boundary** if this gets
  extended.
  - **Central argument:** Search → Apply → Wait is dead because AI made
    applying free, and a signal that costs nothing carries nothing. The
    replacement is an eight-step loop (Discover → Validate → Map → Position →
    Connect → Apply → Follow Up → Convert), compressed into the **SIGNAL**
    mnemonic (Scan, Interrogate, Graph, Narrate, Approach, Loop).
  - **Every substantive claim carries one of three inline marks — `Evidence`,
    `Practice`, `Contested`** — with 22 numbered sources at the end. This is
    the article's spine, not decoration: it separates sourced fact from my
    recommendation from genuinely disputed data. **Do not add an unmarked
    statistic.** Two claims are deliberately debunked rather than repeated:
    the "80% of jobs are never advertised" myth (no credible source) and
    "75% of résumés are rejected by ATS" (same). The Greenhouse channel data
    is used to give the honest version instead.

  - **Three render/layout traps worth remembering:**
    1. **Diagrams need `.figscroll` on mobile.** A 1200-unit viewBox at 390px
       renders 354px wide, which turns 15px labels into 4.4px. Each SVG is
       wrapped in `<div class="figscroll">` with `min-width:840px` under 900px
       so it pans sideways; the `<figcaption>` stays **outside** that div so it
       does not scroll, and a `.fighint` line appears only on narrow screens.
       Don't "simplify" this away.
    2. **Long `<text>` in an SVG silently overruns its `<rect>`** — it happened
       three times (fig 2's red bar, fig 6's disclaimer). There is no wrapping
       in SVG; split into explicit lines and grow the rect *and* the viewBox.
    3. **Figure 1 must stay outside the 740px prose column.** It lives in its
       own `<div class="wrap">` so it renders ~1148px; inside `.col` it was
       688px and the step labels were unreadable.
  - **Share card is generated, not drawn:** `tools/share-cards/the-job-posting-is-not-the-job.card.html`
    is the source. Render with headless Chromium at
    `--force-device-scale-factor=2 --window-size=1200,980`, then crop
    `(0,0,2400,1260)` and downscale to 1200×630. **The taller window is
    required** — a 630px-tall viewport does not composite the bottom ~85px in
    headless Chromium, which silently drops the byline. Fonts were inlined as
    base64 for the render; the archived source links Google Fonts instead.
  - `poster.webp` (sidebar card) and `share-card.png` (deck card + OG/Twitter)
    both live in `images/articles/the-job-posting-is-not-the-job/`.
  - Deck counts updated: **all 147→148, Personality 3→4** (verified against
    actual `data-category` counts in `index.html`).
  - **`refresh_sitemap_lastmod.py --write` was run**, which corrected ~215
    stale `<lastmod>` dates across the whole sitemap in addition to adding the
    new URL. That is why the sitemap diff is large; it is dates only.

- **NEW (2026-09-09): Song 03 published — `devotional-music/ramajogi-mandu/`**
  (*Rāmajōgi Mandu Konarē*, Navaratna 5, Khamās, Ādi). Series now at three
  articles; collection stays at 13 keertanas (this song was already in it).
  - **Thesis:** the commercial conceit. A street hawker's cry sustained for
    three sections *so that it can fail* in caraṇam 2 — `konanu dorakani`,
    not to be had by buying. The marketplace exists to be refused.
  - **This song's entry gained its full text.** It previously shipped with
    `charanams: []` and an honest note; it now has the anupallavi and all four
    caraṇams in Telugu, transliteration and translation.
  - **TWO TEXTUAL CORRECTIONS worth preserving** — circulating versions get
    both wrong, and each one breaks something:
    1. Anupallavi verb is **`bhujiyincharayyā`** — *eat it* (from *bhuji*, to
       eat) — NOT a verb of worship. A medicine you venerate stays outside
       you and the whole pharmacological conceit collapses.
    2. Caraṇam 1 is **`kāṭuka koṇḍalavaṇṭi`** — mountains of *kohl /
       collyrium*, i.e. jet-black and made of the finest grains. Rendering it
       as generic "huge mountains" loses the image: karma accumulates like
       soot, not like boulders.
  - **Other variants flagged on the page, not normalised:** pallavi vocative
    is `pāmarulārā` here but `ō janulārā` in the Navaratna publication; the
    parse of caraṇam 3 (`vāduku cheppina gāni`) varies; longer recensions add
    verses on *mada*/*mātsarya* and on Hari's devotees — not reproduced,
    since uncorroborated.
  - **Caraṇam 3 carries the strongest doctrine in the song:** the Name works
    *even when uttered in argument* — the Ajāmila logic. Note the productive
    tension with the anupallavi's "take it with love": love is how it should
    be taken; the medicine is stronger than the manner of taking.
  - **Rāga contested (second case in the series):** Navaratna gives Khamās,
    Sangeetasudha gives Nādanāmakriya. The article argues these produce
    different theology — cheerful pressing vs. calling to a crowd that won't
    stop. Both presented, neither adjudicated.
  - **Listening upgraded to three corroborated `watch` links**, including
    **Nedunuri Krishnamurthy & Malladi Brothers in Khamās** (`_NuptLD6n2Q`) —
    the ideal source for this repertoire. Six `search` fallbacks remain across
    the collection.

- **NEW (2026-09-08, SECOND pass): the Gita article's ten placeholder SVGs were replaced
  with Paddy's commissioned illustrations.** He called the hand-authored SVGs "childish" —
  they were, they were stick figures — and uploaded real artwork to `images/` as
  `Fig {n} BG for DE.png`. Those are now
  `images/articles/bhagavad-gita-of-data-engineering/fig-NN.webp` (01-07, 09-11; Fig. 8 is
  the HTML LinkedIn mock and has no image).
  - **Every illustration has its caption baked into the artwork.** The figures therefore
    carry **no `<figcaption>`** — adding one prints the caption twice. The caption text
    lives in each `alt` attribute so screen readers still get it. **Do not "restore" the
    figcaptions.**
  - **19.3 MB of PNG -> 1.73 MB of WebP** (quality 82, native dimensions kept; fine print
    still legible at 1:1). The source PNGs were removed from the working tree — they are
    preserved in git history at `d0726af`, `d8f9f4a`, `7d4ac8a`. Regenerate with Pillow;
    the container has no cwebp/ImageMagick, so `pip install Pillow` first.
  - **All figures are now `fig-wide`.** At the 736px prose width the small type in the art
    ("cert. no. 14", "TODO: Be relevant? - 2017") is unreadable.
  - **A tap-to-enlarge lightbox was added**, because at 390px these text-heavy panels are
    otherwise decorative. Watch the CSS: `.lb` sets `display:flex`, which outranks the
    browser's `[hidden]` rule — without the explicit `.lb[hidden]{display:none}` the
    invisible overlay covers the page and swallows **every click on the article**. That bug
    shipped briefly during this session and was caught by a click-through test; keep the
    test if you touch the lightbox.

- **NEW (2026-09-08): "The Bhagavad Gita of Data Engineering" was rewritten, not
  replaced.** The philosophical arc is intact and in the same order (Arjuna freezes -> FOBO
  -> identity/tools -> three Gunas -> Nishkama Karma -> Karma vs Dharma -> architect ->
  numbers -> Sthitaprajna -> manifesto -> Arjuna acts). What changed is the data-engineering
  half: it is now workplace satire, with a recurring cast (**Tamas Tambi**, **Rajas Rao**,
  **Sattva Subramaniam**), mini-dialogues, and **eleven illustrations** (ten hand-authored
  inline SVGs + one HTML LinkedIn-post mock). ~50KB -> ~165KB.
  - **The scripture is never the joke.** Every Sanskrit verse carries its correct chapter and
    verse (2.1, 2.47, 2.56, 14.5, 18.73) with a faithful translation; Krishna is drawn with
    dignity in Fig. 9. A footer note says the characters are satire and the philosophy is not.
    Keep it that way in any future edit.
  - **Three unsourced statistics were removed, not softened.** The old "51% of workers /
    Resume Now-Pew 2026" became the real Pew figure (**52%**, Feb 2025, Oct 2024 fieldwork,
    linked) with its actual wording. The "25% higher salaries" became PwC's **62%** (2026 AI
    Jobs Barometer, linked) *with its methodology caveat spelled out in the body* - it
    compares job ads, not people. The `ClickVision AI Displacement Report, 2026` pull quote
    was **fabricated** and is gone. The invented 65/80/15 Guna bar chart is now an
    interactive self-audit that says outright there is no survey behind it.
  - **Illustration briefs live in `docs/GITA-DE-ILLUSTRATION-BRIEFS.md`** and are duplicated
    as HTML comments above each figure, so commissioned art can replace any SVG in place.
  - `.fig-wide` full-bleed figures use negative margins (`figure.fig.fig-wide`), not
    `transform` - `.reveal` owns `transform` and silently ate the earlier version.
  - `sitemap.xml` has ~220 pre-existing stale `lastmod` values across the whole site. Only
    the two pages touched here were updated by hand;
    `python .github/scripts/refresh_sitemap_lastmod.py --write` is still worth running as
    its own commit.

- **NEW (2026-09-05, FOURTH pass): the Bay Area article was REBUILT as a 17-slide
  visual essay.** Paddy supplied a 17-slide deck (`images/Slide1..17.jpeg`, now
  `images/articles/can-you-really-afford-the-bay-area/slides/slide-01..17.jpg`) and asked
  for it to lead the piece: *"you can massage them and show it accordingly Less text better"*.
  - **~13,900 words -> ~4,700; ~240KB -> ~64KB.** Every table, all six charts and all ten
    hand-drawn SVG illustrations were **removed** - the slides cover that ground. The page is
    now 17 slides + short connective prose, each slide in a lightbox (`#lb`, Escape/backdrop
    close, focus restored to the opening button).
  - `scripts/make_bay_area_charts.py` was **deleted** (orphaned with the charts).
  - **THE FHFA DECISION FROM THE THIRD PASS IS REVERSED.** The note above says the reviewer's
    FHFA back-cast was "tested and rejected" because it puts 1980 housing at 110% of median
    income. Paddy was given that trade-off explicitly and chose **"Slides win - rebuild the
    article"**. `scripts/bay_area_affordability_model.py` is now built on the FHFA path,
    pinned to the deck's published figures, and the article's framing absorbs the result:
    *this house was never within reach of the median household; what changed is the size of
    the gap.* That reframing is what makes the 1980 number coherent rather than absurd.
    **Do not "restore" the modelled series** - it would contradict all 17 slides.
  - Model and deck now agree exactly: P&I+tax as % of income = 100/91/84/70/61/94%;
    price/income = 2.7/3.3/8.1/9.5/10.3/11.6/11.7/12.9. Property tax rate is 1.1%.
  - Cards are now **derived from the cover slide** by
    `images/articles/can-you-really-afford-the-bay-area/source/make_cards.py`:
    `share-card.jpg` (1200x630, padded - PNG was 766KB for a photographic slide) and
    `poster.webp` (800x1000; the whole slide over a blurred enlargement of itself, because a
    straight 4:5 crop sliced the title in half). The old `poster.png/svg`, `share-card.svg`
    and `share-card.png` are gone. **Re-running that script after replacing `slide-01.jpg`
    is all that is needed to sharpen both cards.**
  - **Two slides contradict themselves and need fixing in the re-export** (both are flagged
    in the article's figcaptions as an interim measure, so the page never states a number
    it knows to be wrong):
    - **slide-05.jpg** (deck slide 4): the cartoon panel reads **$1,430** for the 1980
      monthly P&I; the bar chart *on the same slide* reads **$1,773**. $152,000 at 13.74%
      over 30 years is $1,770 - the chart is right, the cartoon is wrong.
    - **slide-04.jpg** (deck slide 3): the 1985 house panel reads **~$360,000** assessed /
      **~$3,000** tax; the stat card below it reads **~$414K** / **~$4,100**. The stat card
      is right ($200,000 compounded at Prop 13 factors reaches ~$414,000).
  - Paddy is sending **higher-resolution slide exports**; they drop in at the same paths.
  - Homepage/metadata: read time 42 -> 15 min, new subtitle and card copy, `hero_image` ->
    `share-card.jpg`. No new article, so the deck counts stay All (147) / Personality (3).
  - Pre-existing and NOT caused by this pass: `index.html` overflows ~23px horizontally at
    390px wide (an SVG in the hero). Present on HEAD too; left alone here.

- **NEW (2026-09-05, third pass): the Bay Area article was CORRECTED after publication**
  following a source-by-source review against Census, FHFA/FRED, Freddie Mac, BLS,
  California BOE, C.A.R., PPIC and IRS. It was already live when the review arrived.
  - **The 2026 anchor moved $2.3M -> $2.2M** (C.A.R. July 2026 county median existing
    single-family price ~$1.955M; the modelled 4BR sits ~13% above it). This cascades
    through every table, both model scripts and three of the six charts.
  - **The income series is now census + SAIPE**, replacing earlier estimates:
    $7,417 (1960, median FAMILY income - a definitional break now flagged in the text),
    $23,369 / $48,115 / $74,705 / $84,627 / $139,462 / $166,984 (2024). The 2010 and
    **2020** rows moved materially ($89,100 -> $84,627 and $126,000 -> $139,462).
    **There is no published 2026 median household income** - $175,000 is labelled an estimate.
  - **CPI now uses the published July 2026 value, 333.918.** $20,000 (1960) = $225,620 today;
    real appreciation ~9.8x.
  - **The headline Part III finding changed: 3.03% -> 3.83%.** It is no longer "almost exactly
    the 2020 rate" and the passage was rewritten. Do not restore the old phrasing.
  - **An FHFA repeat-sales cross-check was added to Part I** with the index values published
    inline so readers can verify. IMPORTANT: the reviewer's proposal to *rebuild* the price
    path by back-casting FHFA from the 2026 anchor was **tested and rejected** - it produces
    1980 housing at **110% of median income** and a 1980 price/income of **8.1**, i.e. 1980
    worse than 2026, which is not defensible. The modelled series is kept and the index is
    used as corroboration (the two agree within ~17% per decade). Do not "fix" this again
    without re-running that test.
  - **The "non-housing family cost" column was removed** from the generational table -
    a modelled nominal 1960 family spend cannot be defended and invites easy attack.
  - Softened: "you cannot refinance a principal" (principal amortises and can be prepaid).
    The three-year career horizon is now explicitly a **stress-test assumption**, with PPIC
    survey data (49% / 32% / 57%) supplied as the defensible evidence instead.
  - A dated **Corrections** block and a note that FRED was unreachable from the authoring
    environment (so the FHFA values are quoted, not read) sit above the Sources section.

- **NEW (2026-09-05, second pass): six data charts added to the Bay Area article.**
  The first cut was 13.5k words against 10 illustrations - one visual per ~1,350
  words, and 75% of the text sat in unbroken runs of 450+ words. It read as an
  essay with pictures rather than a visual essay. Six charts now bring that to
  **one visual per ~870 words**, with 63% in long runs.
  - **Source of truth is `scripts/make_bay_area_charts.py`**, which emits the SVG.
    Values are copied from the two model scripts; change a number there, re-run
    both, then re-run this and re-paste. Do not hand-edit the chart SVG in the
    article.
  - **The palette is validated, not chosen.** The article's editorial ink colours
    FAIL as a categorical chart palette - #23527C and #1F6B4A fall under the
    OKLCH chroma floor (they read gray as fills) and green/red sit at deltaE 6.6
    under deuteranopia. Charts therefore use a separate validated split:
    series **#2E74B5**, emphasis **#A32B22**, ordinal ramp
    **#93B6D4 -> #3D7DB5 -> #1B4E7A**. All pass the six checks on the #FCFBF7
    surface. **The original #23527C stays for line art and text** - it is fine
    there, it just is not a data fill. If charts are ever added, re-run the
    validator rather than eyeballing a new colour.
  - **Forms follow the data's job:** price-to-income and deposit-in-years are
    single-series columns with emphasis on 2026; the housing-cost breakdown is an
    ordinal stack (the segments have a natural order) with a 100%-of-income rule;
    the budget is nominal categories so every bar takes the SAME hue (colouring
    them by value would double-encode bar length); cash runway is bars against an
    18-month threshold; years-of-freedom is two runway bars.
  - **Charts scroll sideways below 720px** rather than scaling down - at 390px the
    1000-unit viewBox shrinks axis type to ~3px. Same treatment the wide tables
    already get, with the same `.scrollhint`.
  - A hover tooltip layer is attached to `.chart .bar` groups. It **enhances and
    never gates**: every charted value also appears in a direct label or in the
    article's existing tables, which are the accessible table-view twin.

- **NEW (2026-09-05): `articles/can-you-really-afford-the-bay-area.html` is published** —
  a ~13.5k-word data-driven visual investigation in twelve parts: whether an
  ordinary professional family could build *and protect* a middle-class life in
  Santa Clara County in each decade from 1960 to 2026. Category `personality`,
  42 min, dated 2026-09-05. Homepage sidebar + deck card added by hand; filter
  counts bumped to **All (147)** and **Personality Development (3)**; sitemap
  entry added.
  - **All arithmetic is reproducible and was computed, not estimated by eye.**
    The anchor is a modelled representative 4-bedroom house (county median
    single-family sale price × ~1.10), 20% down, 30-year fixed, every decade.
    Headline results: price-to-income 2.6 in 1960 → 13.1 in 2026; total annual
    housing cost 28% of median income in 1960 → **104%** in 2026; the down
    payment goes from 5 months of median income to 2 years 8 months.
  - **The strongest finding, and the one to preserve if the piece is ever
    edited:** the rate needed on today's $1.84M loan to reproduce 1980's
    burden (53% of median income) is **3.03%** — i.e. almost exactly the 2020
    rate. The 2020–21 window made a $1.8M loan *behave* like a 1980 mortgage;
    remove it and principal is the binding constraint. Corollary line:
    "You can refinance a rate. You cannot refinance a principal."
  - **Data-integrity scheme is load-bearing.** Every figure carries one of four
    tags — FACT / ESTIMATE / MODELLING ASSUMPTION / SCENARIO — explained in a
    legend near the top. The 1960 and 1970 county rows are explicitly the
    softest (±15%) and say so. **Do not quietly upgrade an estimate to a fact.**
  - **One deliberate modelling choice worth keeping:** maintenance is modelled
    as a *physical* cost (~$4.30/sq ft/yr in 2026 dollars, CPI-deflated and
    scaled to house size), **not** as 1% of purchase price. Roofs do not get
    more expensive because land does; the 1%-of-price rule over-reserves badly
    in the Bay Area because you are reserving against dirt.
  - **Central concept introduced: YEARS OF FINANCIAL FREEDOM** — accessible
    assets (cash + taxable, excluding retirement and home equity) divided by
    essential annual burn. The Part XI pair have net worth within 3% of each
    other ($3.2M vs $3.3M) and freedom of **1.4 years vs 10.5 years**. If the
    article is ever excerpted, this is the idea to lead with.
  - **Ten illustrations, all hand-authored inline SVG** in the article itself
    (no build step, unlike The Interview Room). Editorial newspaper style:
    hatched money stacks, stick figures, no photorealism. All are XML-valid —
    `validate_content.py` is strict on changed files, so keep them well-formed.
  - **Share card and homepage poster are generated**, not hand-drawn:
    `images/articles/can-you-really-afford-the-bay-area/source/make_cards.py`
    authors both as SVG and renders `share-card.png` (1200×630) and
    `poster.webp` (800×860). Re-run after `pip install cairosvg pillow`; the
    container only has Liberation/DejaVu fonts, which is why the script names
    those explicitly rather than Newsreader. Do not hand-edit the outputs.
  - **Research caveat for future sessions:** `WebFetch` was blocked for every
    domain by the egress proxy in this session, so primary sources could not be
    opened directly — figures were confirmed via `WebSearch` result summaries
    and are cited to the primary source they originate from. Anything in the
    Sources section is worth spot-checking against the live source before it is
    quoted elsewhere.

- **NEW (2026-09-04): `articles/the-interview-room.html` is published** — a
  ~19k-word fictional screenplay in fifteen acts: a staff-level escalation
  interview at the fictional **Northstar Data Platforms** between hiring
  manager **Alex Morgan** and candidate **Jordan Lee**. Category `technology`,
  55 min, dated 2026-09-04.
  - **Everything in it is fictional and is labelled as such** in three places:
    the notice block near the top, the closing disclaimer, and the JSON-LD
    (`"genre": "Fiction"`). No real company, product vendor or person is named
    or implied — that constraint was explicit and must be preserved if the
    article is ever edited. Open-source project names (Spark, Kafka, Airflow)
    are fine; commercial vendors are not.
  - **Fifteen illustrations are generated, not hand-written HTML.** The source
    of truth is `images/articles/the-interview-room/source/make_plates.py`,
    which authors each plate as SVG and renders a 2x PNG (kept in `source/`)
    plus the `plate-*.webp` the page loads, plus `share-card.png` and
    `poster.webp`. Re-run it after `pip install pillow cairosvg`; do not edit
    the webp files by hand.
  - Article CSS is a self-contained screenplay system: `.slug`, `.dir`, `.cue`
    (with `.cue--a` / `.cue--j` for the two characters), `.beat` for rapid-fire
    exchanges, `.term` for log/plan blocks, `pre.ascii` for diagrams, and the
    `.panel--test` / `.panel--weak` pair that closes most scenes.
  - Homepage: sidebar card + deck card added by hand (per CLAUDE.md, `index.html`
    is never regenerated). Filter counts bumped to **All (146)** and
    **Technology (77)**; sitemap entry added.

- **NEW (2026-09-03): Song 02 of the Devotional Music series is published.**
  `devotional-music/caranamule-nammiti/` — *Caraṇamulē Nammiti*, rāga Kāpi,
  Ādi. The collection is now **13 keertanas and 13 ragams** (counts appear in
  the hub header tags, the "All 13" filter button, the section intro, the
  JSON-LD description, and the homepage card — update all of them together).
  - **The article's thesis:** repetition as *bhāva intensifier*, not esoteric
    code. Six verses, each ending in one word said three times (varadā, ayyā,
    caraṇamu, paṭṭiti, ayyā, dāsuḍa). Key line: "The dictionary has not
    changed. The heart has."
  - **Three genuine textual findings, all TEXTUAL-labelled and worth keeping:**
    1. Every caraṇam ends on the bare `nī divya` — an adjective with no noun —
       which completes only on the return to the pallavi. Same antādi joinery
       as Rama Dayajudave.
    2. In caraṇams 2, 5 and 6 the repeated word is **extracted from the
       preceding word**: sēyakum-*ayyā* → ayyā ayyā; rāv-*ayyā* → ayyā ayyā;
       rāmadāsu*ḍa* → dāsuḍa dāsuḍa. A suffix breaks free of its grammar and
       becomes pure address.
    3. The **mudra dissolves**: the signature is Bhadrāchala Rāmadāsuḍa, and
       the word that repeats is the tail of his own name. Place-name and god's
       name fall away; the common noun *servant* is what is left.
  - **Textual variant preserved, not normalised:** caraṇam 2 reads *ādi puruṣa*
    in some sources and *ādiśēṣa* in others; translations of *aramara* (అరమర —
    reserve, holding back) also split on direction. Both flagged in data.js and
    in the article.
  - **`veyyāru`** is literally 1006 (veyyi + āru) but idiomatic for "countless".
    Do not over-literalise it.
  - **Kāpi added** to RAGAS + RAGA_DETAIL with the important warning that
    **Carnatic Kāpi is not Hindustani Kāfi** (Kāfi maps closer to
    Kharaharapriya itself).

- **Listening links for Song 02 are the best-corroborated so far** — four
  `kind:"watch"` entries whose indexed titles name the composition, including
  a Balamuralikrishna rendition (`T1Kk2qwo8Go`) and two that state Kāpi/Ādi in
  the title. Still **not liveness-verified** — YouTube remains blocked by the
  egress proxy. Same two-tier model and same open caveat on the page.

- **New article CSS components** (in `article.css`, reusable for later songs):
  `.triple-strip`, `.rendering`, `.seq`, `.dissolve`, `.ladder`, `.remnant`,
  `.arch`. The dissolve block is the strike-through of the mudra; the remnant
  block is the bare-words display.

- **NEW (2026-09-03, second pass): the Devotional Music section gained an
  EXPERIENCE layer.** The reference material was kept; what was added turns it
  into somewhere you can also hear the music. Three layers now: sahityam (what
  he said) / sangitam (how the music carries it) / anubhavam (what you may
  experience).
  - **Per song (all 12):** `beforePlay` (a 2–4 sentence emotional preparation),
    `keyWord` (the one word that holds the song — literal / colloquial /
    spiritual / why), `cues` (3–5 listening cues, 45 total), `listening`
    (recordings), and `modern` on 5 of them (a restrained contemporary
    reflection — deliberately NOT self-help).
  - **New hub views:** `#listen` (Paddy's Listening Room — reader-journey strip
    + a 6-column index table) and `#voice` (Ramadasu Is Not Praying Politely —
    a 9-stage progression from asking to seeing, plus the Navaratna arc).
    The Tradition view gained Concert Hall vs Bhajan Hall and Why These Songs
    Survived. A quiet coda closes the page, after all scholarship.
  - **Deep links now support `#<view>` as well as `#kriti-<id>`** (see
    `applyHash` in app.js). The article links to `../#listen`.
  - **EVIDENCE LABELS — the important new discipline.** Every esoteric reading
    carries `evidence`: TEXTUAL (supported by the sahityam) / TRADITIONAL
    (established commentarial tradition) / INTERPRETIVE (a PaddySpeaks
    contemplative reading). 44 in data.js, 16 more in the article. Every
    listening cue carries `provenance`: text / tradition / rendition, so a later
    performance practice is never presented as Ramadasu's own mark. **Keep
    labelling new entries — this is what protects the interpretations'
    credibility.**
  - **Absolute claims were audited and softened** ("no other composer…",
    "the tradition reserves…", "the only…", "alone in this set…"). Ragam
    `bhava` fields were reworded from "X means sadness" shapes to "often used
    for…". Do not reintroduce rasa-as-property phrasing.
  - **Ragam sections deepened:** each of the 12 now has `prayogas`, `jiva`,
    `gamaka`, `distinguish` (the scale-neighbour it is confused with) and
    `withText`. Note the Dhanyasi vs Suddha Dhanyasi warning.
  - **Corrections made this pass:** Kantinedu Ma Ramula is **Khanda Chapu**,
    not Adi (per the Nedunuri notation volume). The Navaratna ORDER was
    verified against that volume and matches: Adigo → Sri Rama Namame → Paluke
    → Divyanama → Ramajogi → Taraka → Hari Hari Rama → Takkuvemi → Kantinedu.
    The emotional arc built on it is presented as **interpretive**, with an
    explicit caveat that Ramadasu is not known to have composed them as a cycle.

- **⚠️ LISTENING LINKS — UNFINISHED, NEEDS A HUMAN PASS.**
  YouTube is **blocked by the container's egress proxy** (WebFetch, curl, and
  even the oEmbed endpoint all rejected), so **no recording was played or
  checked for liveness**. The link model is deliberately two-tier:
  - `kind:"watch"` (8 entries) — video id came from a search index whose
    recorded title matches the composition, and in one case the performer
    (Nedunuri + Malladi, Atana, `0HMHlarLZwo`). **Corroborated, not verified.**
  - `kind:"search"` (7 entries) — a YouTube *search* URL. Correct by
    construction, cannot rot, cannot point at the wrong thing.
  - **To promote a search link to a real one:** set `kind:"watch"` and add
    `id:"<videoId>"`. The renderer does the rest. See the header comment in the
    ENRICH block of `data.js`.
  - The page states this limitation openly in `LISTEN_CAVEAT`. **Do not quietly
    publish unverified watch links** — it would contradict the page's own
    editorial rule.
  - Still needing a corroborated recording: Sri Ramula Divyanama, Ramajogi
    Mandu, Hari Hari Rama, Rama Dayajudave, Ikshvaku Kula Tilaka, Ee Teeruga Nanu.

- **Still open from the first pass:** the Telugu script for charanams 2 and 3 of
  Rama Dayajudave was set from transliterated sources, not a printed Telugu
  edition. Worth a rasika's check.

- **NEW (2026-09-03): a Devotional Music section, built as a SERIES.**
  Lives at `devotional-music/` and is wired into `index.html` (nav-bar link +
  a hand-written section card) and `sitemap.xml`. PR #797 (draft).
  - **The shape is hub + one article per song**, not one big page. The hub
    (`devotional-music/index.html` + `data.js` + `app.js` + `style.css`) holds
    12 Ramadasu keertanas including all 9 Navaratnas, with Telugu text,
    transliteration, meanings, ragam/talam and esoteric commentary. Five views:
    Keertanas, Ragams (12, with arohana/avarohana), The Composer, The Tradition
    (sampradaya bhajan + glossary), Search.
  - **`article.css` is the shared skin for every future song article** — reuse it
    rather than writing a new stylesheet per song.
  - **Song 01 is live:** `devotional-music/rama-dayajudave/` — an 18-part
    long-form article (glance card, composer, text in four layers, sahitya deep
    dive, three-level esoteric reading, daya, ragam + tala, version comparison,
    kriti-vs-nama, nama mahima, listening cues, mudra, research note, listening
    room, related songs, reflection, sources).
  - **EDITORIAL RULES — keep them if you add songs.** They are written into the
    header comment of `data.js` too.
    1. Ramadasu left *sahityam*, not notation. Every ragam carries a
       `ragaConfidence` of `established` or `varies`; where sources disagree,
       show the disagreement (Rama Dayajudave is sung in Bhairavi, Dhanyasi AND
       Keeravani). Never silently pick one.
    2. Reproduce lyrics only as far as they can be corroborated. Say where the
       text stops; never invent a charanam, ragam, tala or anecdote.
    3. Songs by other composers that get misattributed to Ramadasu go in
       `MISATTRIBUTED`, never in `KRITIS`. Already caught: **Ksheerabdhi
       Kanyakaku** (Annamacharya) and **Nanu Palimpa** (Tyagaraja).
    4. Pallavi of Rama Dayajudave follows the better-attested
       `bhadrachala dhama` reading; the `bhadrachala rama` variant is noted.
    5. Devotional legend (the mohurs) is told as tradition, not as history.
  - **Design brief:** ivory/sandalwood, deep maroon, muted temple gold,
    restrained saffron; line-drawn SVG motifs only (gopuram, tambura, jalra,
    lamp). No deity imagery, no neon, no giant Om. A full-page ruled
    "manuscript" texture was tried and **removed** — it banded across body text.
    Don't reintroduce it.
  - **Next songs** would naturally be Paluke Bangaramayena, Ee Teeruga Nanu, or
    Ikshvaku Kula Tilaka; the goal discussed was 15–20 Ramadasu articles, not
    just the famous concert pieces. Each new article should also get a
    `sitemap.xml` entry and an `article` field on its kriti in `data.js` (that
    field is what renders the "Read the full article" CTA on the hub card).
  - **Open question for a rasika:** the Telugu script for charanams 2 and 3 of
    Rama Dayajudave was set from transliterated sources, not a printed Telugu
    edition. Worth a check.

- **NEW (2026-08-27, revision pass): the Spark track was hardened after review.**
  Eight fixes, all verification and readability — deliberately no new topics.
  - **Added `#refs`, a References & version notes appendix.** Maps each question
    to the Apache Spark doc page that answers it, plus a version-caveat table
    (AQE default-on from 3.2, `REBALANCE` from 3.3, ANSI default in 4.0, Storage
    Partition Join's per-release support, structured logging, serializer, Arrow).
    **The doc URLs could not be verified from the container — `spark.apache.org`
    is blocked by the egress proxy.** Only long-stable canonical paths were used;
    click through once before promoting the page anywhere.
  - **Removed absolutes the page could not defend.** "Every problem lives at
    exactly one level" now says every incident has a *primary* layer, with an
    explicit cascade example (skew → spill → disk → GC → heartbeat → executor
    loss → FetchFailed). "Spill is the only honest memory metric" now reads as
    *most actionable*, alongside Peak Execution Memory. Partition-pruning advice
    now says function-wrapping and type coercion *can prevent or weaken* pruning
    and tells the reader to check `PartitionFilters` rather than assume.
  - **Fixed an AQE inconsistency in four places.** "AQE cannot split what was
    never divided" contradicted the page's own skew-splitting material; all four
    now say coalescing merges, skew handling can split an *eligible* partition,
    and neither rescues a uniformly under-partitioned stage.
  - **Corrected two counts.** The TOC now holds exactly 30 numbered parts with
    artifacts and references as separate coda links. The drill count was wrong in
    both directions at different times — the real figure is **39 (21 inline + 18
    dedicated)** and the strip now says so.
  - **Breathing room + print styles.** Interview boxes, config tables, the matrix,
    case files and runbook cells all got larger type and more padding; a
    `@media print` block keeps cases and drills from splitting across pages.

- **NEW (2026-08-27): Interview Studio gained a Spark track** —
  `interview.app/spark/index.html`, a ~480 KB self-contained deep-dive: "The Spark
  Pipeline Debugging & Performance Engineering Handbook". It sits in the **Learn**
  hub alongside Performance / Dashboarding / AI Engineering, and is a full Studio
  page (`studio.css` + `.netflix-prep` skin + track-local Spark-orange styles).
  - **30 parts** — triage, UI + log forensics, memory, GC, skew, shuffle, joins,
    driver, CPU, files, partitioning, storage-partition joins, caching, sizing,
    stragglers, network, disk, SQL anti-patterns, data-quality look-alikes,
    regressions, cost, the scientific method, a 34-row troubleshooting matrix,
    20 case files, 33 interview drills, a config reference, observability and
    prevention — closing with three one-page artefacts (decision tree, UI cheat
    sheet, production runbook).
  - **31 original inline SVG diagrams**, all token-driven (`.dg-*` classes) so
    dark mode works without a second palette. Every one validated as well-formed
    XML by `.github/scripts/validate_content.py`'s SVG check.
  - **Editorial rules baked into the page — keep them if you edit it.** Every
    environment-specific claim carries a label: `Apache Spark default`,
    `Platform-dependent`, `Workload-dependent heuristic`, `Version-dependent`.
    Vendor defaults (Databricks / EMR / Glue / Dataproc / Synapse) are never
    presented as Apache defaults, and the page repeatedly tells the reader to
    verify in the Environment tab rather than trust a quoted default. Where a
    value has moved across the 3.x line (AQE skew thresholds, memoryOverhead
    factor, serializer) it is deliberately NOT stated as a number.
  - **Wiring:** added to `interview.app/partials/nav.html` (Learn hub, desktop +
    mobile) then propagated with `python3 interview.app/build_nav.py` — 34 pages
    updated, do not hand-edit the nav in individual pages. Pillar card
    `hp-feat-card-19` added to `interview.app/index.html`. `sitemap.xml` entry
    added. A `next-card` cross-link added to `interview.app/performance/`.
  - **Layout note:** wide artefacts (`.matrix-scroll`, `.fig.wide`, `.sheet`)
    break out of the 980 px reading column above 1080 px via negative margins,
    and every plain table becomes its own scroll container below 860 px. Verified
    zero horizontal page overflow at 390 / 1400 px in light and dark.

- **NEW (2026-08-21, latest): article "The Subject Nobody Taught" shipped** —
  `articles/the-subject-nobody-taught.html`, category `personality`, self-contained
  (inline CSS/SVG/JS). A visual essay on financial literacy as a missing school
  subject.
  - **The supplied artwork is used WHOLE. Never crop, trim, or re-frame it.** An
    earlier pass cut the images into plates and icons and was reverted at the
    author's request. Every `plate-*.webp` is a straight, aspect-preserving
    conversion of its file in `source/`; only `plate-flywheel.webp` is resampled
    (1535 -> 1200 px wide) and nothing is cropped. If you add artwork, convert the
    whole file.
  - **The artwork is the diagram on wide screens; the HTML is the reading layer on
    narrow ones.** A single `@media(min-width:861px)` rule hides `.lifecycle`,
    `.missing-strip`, `.principles`, `.loop-list` and `.narrow-only`, so desktop
    shows the images alone and phones get real markup at a legible size. Alt text
    carries the full content either way. Do not delete the HTML versions — they are
    what makes the page work at 375px and for screen readers.
  - **Images 6 (compounding) and 7 (start early) are deliberately NOT in the page.**
    Their figures are wrong in the pixels: image 6 has garbled bar labels and a
    duplicated "Contributed $120,000"; image 7's $650,000 does not follow from
    $500/month at 8%. Their two sections use inline-SVG charts built from figures
    computed in-repo instead. **Drop the images in as plates the moment fixed
    versions arrive** — that is exactly what happened with image 9, which was
    re-supplied at 1535x1024 with TEACH restored and "INEEP" fixed, and is now the
    flywheel graphic.
  - **The financial figures are load-bearing and were verified.** $500/month at 8%
    nominal compounded monthly: 10y $91,473 · 20y $294,510 · 30y $745,180 · 40y
    $1,745,504. Contributions are $6,000/yr. The early-vs-late pair is Priya (25->65,
    $240,000 in) vs Raj (35->65, $180,000 in) — $60,000 more contributed, $1,000,324
    more at the end. If you touch a number, re-derive the SVG path data with it; the
    polyline points and the prose must not drift apart.
  - Chart labels live in **HTML positioned over the SVG**, not inside it, so they stay
    legible at 375px. The SVGs carry geometry only and use `preserveAspectRatio="none"`
    with an explicit `height:clamp(215px,30vw,360px)`.
  - Everything renders with **JavaScript off** — reveals only hide once `has-js` is on
    the root, counters carry their final values as literal text, and the chart wipe is
    `display:none` without JS and under `prefers-reduced-motion`.

- **NEW (2026-08-17, latest): community submissions were being silently dropped
  on unknown topic labels — fixed in `.github/scripts/ingest_submissions.py`.**
  The Google Form lets people type their own topic. `TOPIC_MAP` only knew
  python/sql/design variants, so rows labelled "Data Modelling" and
  "Dashboarding" hit `SKIP — unknown topic`, were marked processed, and were
  gone for good (the state file is the only dedupe). Two real submissions
  (Freddie Mac data-modeling process, Virtusa non-prod dashboard test data)
  were lost that way and have now been written by hand into
  `interview.app/evaluate/data/design.json` as `ds-new-059` / `ds-new-060`,
  `type: open`, `source: community`.
  - The map now covers modelling/dashboarding/BI/ETL/etc., and anything still
    unrecognised is routed by the wording of the question (`ROUTING`) with a
    `design` fallback. **Nothing is dropped for an unknown topic any more** — a
    mis-filed question is visible and fixable, a dropped one is not.
  - `source: "community"` is what lights up the ◆ Community badge in the quiz
    engine and floats the question on `/interview.app/whats-new/`. Anything
    added by hand from the sheet must carry it.
  - **Skill Check counts were 2 years stale** (`791` in the title/meta/schema
    vs `1656` actual, "4-section" vs six sections) because nothing refreshed
    them. `interview/scripts/update_counts.py` now derives Skill Check pool
    sizes from `interview.app/evaluate/data/*.json` too, and both question
    workflows (`weekly-questions.yml`, `ingest-submissions.yml`) run it before
    committing. Also fixed: the prerender lede said "…Snowflake and 107 other
    companies" when 107 is the total including the 8 it just named.

- **NEW (2026-08-12, latest): article "Consequences Don't Transfer" shipped.**
  Supplied as one flat infographic PNG plus a self-contained HTML draft with all
  16 images inlined as sloppy base64 crops (label chips duplicated, neighbouring
  panels bleeding in, captions clipped). Both files had junk names and are gone.
  - Artwork now lives in `images/articles/consequences-dont-transfer/` — 22
    re-trimmed WebP files on exact panel boundaries, plus the untouched
    `source-infographic.png` and a 1200x630 `share-card.png`.
  - The hero elephant and the five "why advice fails" icons have their cream
    paper knocked out (border-connected flood fill), so they float on the page.
    Do not re-flatten them onto a white box.
  - Case strips are a **justified flex row**: `--ar` on each `.ps-shot` is the
    frame's true aspect ratio, which gives all three a shared height with zero
    cropping. If you add a frame, set its `--ar` or the row will go ragged.
  - Page went 2.0 MB -> ~91 KB of HTML. Never re-inline the images as base64.
  - Re-crop script kept out of the repo; boundaries are documented by the
    filenames themselves.

- **NEW (2026-08-10, latest): hosted removal is PLANNED BUT GATED — read
  `docs/HOSTED-REMOVAL.md` before writing a line of it.** The natural next ask
  is "let users press go and we do the removals for them". Do not start that.
  **The blocker is legal, not technical.** Submitting a privacy request on
  someone else's behalf makes us an *authorized agent*, which the CCPA defines
  as a natural person or **a business entity registered with the California
  Secretary of State** — a personal blog cannot do it. Three consequences:
  a registered entity is required first; each user must give **signed
  permission** a broker may demand to see; and the broker may **bypass us and
  verify the consumer directly**, so any design must pull the user back into
  the loop rather than promise press-go-and-forget.
  - Infrastructure is the cheap part (~$150–300/month at low volume). The
    expensive parts are legal setup, insurance, and the permanent maintenance
    load of broker forms changing underneath us.
  - Two facts that should inform the decision before any code: California's
    **DROP does broker deletion free and with legal force**, so a paid
    submission service competes with the state; and form-submission is a
    commodity several companies already sell. The differentiator is the
    explanation layer already built here, not the submitting.
  - Recommended path if it goes ahead: **email-first** (a written request is
    legally valid, fully automatable, no browser, no CAPTCHA, leaves a paper
    trail), browser automation added later only for form-only sites.
  - **No decision has been made.** Awaiting a human call on the path and on
    the legal step. Nothing in the build order is safe to start before that.

- **NEW (2026-08-10, latest): the Privacy Console is LIVE at
  `paddyspeaks.com/privacy/`**, alongside the `privacy-agent/` CLI. Design
  notes: **`docs/PRIVACY-AGENT.md`**; user docs:
  **`privacy-agent/README.md`**. Read those before touching it.
  - **One engine, two front ends.** `privacy-agent/src/core/` is pure ES
    modules with zero Node dependencies, so `privacy/app.js` imports the *same*
    files the CLI does, straight from `../privacy-agent/src/core/`. That is the
    whole reason the browser scoring cannot drift from the CLI scoring — do not
    add a Node import (`fs`, `path`, `crypto`) to anything under `core/`, or
    the web app breaks instantly and silently.
  - Pure logic in `core/`: identity normalization, identity graph, match
    confidence, risk, dedupe, state machine, redaction, jurisdiction,
    removability, query generation, attack surface, `explain.js` (the four
    questions on every exposure card), `optout.js` (ranks a page's own links
    to find the removal route) and `resume.js` (below). Tests:
    **`node privacy-agent/tests/run.mjs` — 219 pass**, dependency-free.
    The Worker side is covered by **`node analytics/tests/run.mjs` — 172 pass**.
  - **`core/resume.js` — the handback is the main path, not the failure path.**
    Every removal route eventually stops and asks the user for something, and
    the strongest verification sits on exactly the sites worth removing from
    (see `docs/HOSTED-REMOVAL.md`). The console renders a "waiting on you"
    panel above the board from `resumeQueue`, ordered by risk.
    - **The instruction is rebuilt against the current clock, never stored.**
      This is the whole point of the module. The agent's blocked notes were
      written at the moment of blocking and several describe a live browser
      ("the form is open, we will enter the code"); that is true for minutes.
      `resumeFor(exposure, now)` returns "enter the code in the open window"
      while the window plausibly exists and "request a fresh code, that one has
      expired" once it does not. Freshness per block kind is in `FRESHNESS_MS`.
    - Staleness reads the blocking transition out of `history`, not
      `updatedAt` — otherwise an unrelated re-score makes an hour-old code look
      fresh. Unknown age is treated as stale on purpose: sending someone to a
      window we cannot see is the worse bet.
    - `now` is a parameter, never `Date.now()` inside the logic. That is what
      makes staleness testable; keep it that way.

  - **Invariants with tests named for them — do not "fix" these:** a name match
    alone can never confirm; absence is not evidence; `submitted` ≠ `removed`
    (the state machine forbids the shortcut); no hardcoded broker list; no
    guessed opt-out URLs (an invented `/opt-out` is a confident 404, which is
    worse than "not found"); sensitive fields (SSN/ID/licence/passport) never
    auto-fill; payment is never made; workflow templates carry no PII.
  - **The Worker DOES serve the console now** — this reverses an earlier note
    in this file that said never to wire it up. `analytics/worker/scan.js`
    provides `/api/scan` (search proxy), `/api/scan/read` (fetch one page,
    return text + links) and `/api/scan/status`. It exists because a browser
    page cannot fetch third-party sites: CORS forbids it.
    - **The identity-dossier rule is unchanged and still absolute.** The Worker
      logs nothing, stores nothing (it touches no D1 binding), and caches
      nothing (`no-store` on every response). Queries and URLs pass through and
      are discarded. No identity data is persisted server-side, ever.
    - Both transmissions are disclosed on the page itself, in the assurance
      box, in plain words — the search terms for *Scan for me*, and the listing
      URL for *Find the opt-out*. If you change what leaves the browser, change
      that copy in the same commit. A tool that quietly starts sending a home
      address while still promising "nothing leaves your browser" is doing
      exactly what the brokers do.
    - `/api/scan/read` is a fetch proxy, so `isFetchable()` is a security
      control, not a convenience check: allowlisted schemes plus a denylist of
      loopback/private/link-local/cloud-metadata hosts. Tested in
      `analytics/tests/run.mjs`. Do not relax it.
  - **`API_BASE` is `https://ps.paddyspeaks.com`, not `paddyspeaks.com/api/*`.**
    paddyspeaks.com is GitHub Pages, so a relative `/api/scan` resolves to a
    static 404 — which is exactly how the first live scan came back "0 found"
    with a row of green ticks. Same convention as `lib/ps-forms.js`.
  - Search keys are **Worker Secrets**: `BRAVE_SEARCH_API_KEY` (preferred — no
    daily cap) or `GOOGLE_CSE_KEY` + `GOOGLE_CSE_ID` (100/day). With no key the
    console says so and falls back to the paste flow; it never scrapes result
    pages. See the warning in `wrangler.toml` — a plaintext var is wiped on the
    next Git-integrated deploy.
  - **The website never submits anything, and cannot.** A page may not fill in
    or submit a form on another origin — same-origin policy, the rule that stops
    any open tab posting from your bank. So the console stops at the submit
    button by law of the platform, not by choice, and the removal engine is the
    CLI. `privacy-agent import <export.json>` carries a console session into the
    vault (`core/handoff.js`), then `run --mission` files the requests. The
    bridge deliberately refuses to inherit a `pending_removal` or
    `successfully_removed` status from the browser: the agent must witness a
    submission itself, since those two states are exactly what this project
    will not take on trust. Rejected records never cross.
  - The CLI additionally drives real Chromium and submits forms, which a static
    page cannot. Verified end-to-end against a local fixture broker with a real
    opt-out form: real submission, case number + processing window parsed,
    encrypted evidence screenshots, and the SSN field correctly blocking
    submission. `npm install` needed in `privacy-agent/` (only dep is
    `playwright`).
  - Still open, raised with the user and unanswered: hero dashboard preview
    populated from the real profile, an exposure-over-time chart (needs
    per-scan history nothing records yet), an aggregate stats bar (**must use
    the user's real numbers — never seed figures**), and a possible rename.
- **2026-08-08: Polish Sprint Wednesday — PS-05, PS-07, PS-08**
  on branch `claude/weekly-action-plan-kjgt5b`. Two new shared modules under
  `interview.app/js/`:
  - **`pg-states.js`** — the engine boot skeleton (PS-05) and the empty-state
    renderer (PS-08) for both playgrounds. Boot progress is **by completed
    milestone, not a percentage**: neither sql.js/PGlite nor Pyodide reports
    byte progress, so a percentage would be invented. Three steps —
    download, open, seed. The skeleton never paints over results already on
    screen, and SQL retires it inside `activateEngine()` (after CSV seeding),
    which is the first moment the pane can actually take a query.
  - **`pg-shortcuts.js`** — PS-07. A page declares `window.PG_SHORTCUTS`; each
    entry names a **button id**, and the shortcut clicks that real button, so
    the keyboard and the toolbar can never disagree. `?` opens the cheatsheet,
    and a `? shortcuts` affordance is injected into `.pg-editor-toolbar`.
    Bare-letter shortcuts are suppressed while typing (`isTyping()` checks for
    INPUT/TEXTAREA/SELECT/contentEditable); modifier combos still fire inside
    the editor. **Note the toolbar class is `.pg-editor-toolbar`, not
    `.pg-toolbar`** — that cost a round.
  - PS-08 also fixed a genuinely blank state: filtering the company or topic
    picker in `evaluate/index.html` to zero matches rendered **nothing at
    all** (`.cp-empty` was styled but never used). It now names the term and
    notes that existing selections stay active while hidden by the filter.
  - Remaining sprint: **Thu PS-02** (CodeMirror 6, vendored locally under
    `vendor/`, NO runtime CDN, keep textarea as the no-JS fallback), **Fri
    PS-03/PS-13/PS-12/PS-14/PS-10 + QA**.
- **2026-08-06: CareerOS shipped** — `/careeros/`, an independent design
  prototype of an "AI-native professional network" (PR #756, branch
  `claude/careeros-prototype-design-eti35a`). 46 files, ~11.3k lines, vanilla
  ES modules with no build step: `js/store.js` + `js/dom.js` + per-view and
  per-component modules, persona-driven dashboards with user-rearrangeable
  panels, explainability drawer, recruiter trust metrics, philosophy page.
  **It already exists — check before building anything CareerOS-shaped.**
- **2026-07-28: Polish Sprint Mon + Tue merged** — PR #743 (PS-01 theme
  unification, PS-09 single focus ring, PS-11 blue purge) and PR #744 (PS-04
  value-first Skill Check, PS-06 toolbar hierarchy).
- **2026-07-28: Skill Check empty-pool dead end fixed** (PR #745). A saved
  refinement of Hard + Code empties three of the six sections outright —
  **2026 Hot Topics, AI Engineering and Communication have no code-format
  questions at all** (52 / 152 / 119 questions, every one `single` or
  `multi`). Section cards with a filtered pool of 0 now drop their `href`
  entirely, and the quiz dead end offers "Clear the filter & start
  <section>", which removes the offending localStorage key. **The content gap
  itself is still open** — authoring code questions for those three sections
  is a content decision nobody has taken.
- **2026-07-28: Testimonials + Contact moved into the Studio nav** (PR #746).
  They now live in a fifth `Connect` hub in `interview.app/partials/nav.html`
  (run `python3 interview.app/build_nav.py` after editing it — 33 pages), and
  were removed from the main-site top nav on `index.html`, `about.html` and
  `resume.html`. **Footers on all three still carry both links**, as does
  About's "Send a message" CTA — nothing became unreachable.

- **NEW (2026-07-25, latest): Contact + Testimonials shipped** on branch
  `claude/paddyspeaks-contact-testimonials-4zne28`. Full write-up:
  **`docs/CONTACT-AND-TESTIMONIALS.md`** (read that first for anything here).
  - New pages: `/contact/`, `/testimonials/` (public list + share form), and
    `/testimonials/admin.html` (owner moderation console — noindex, robots-blocked,
    reuses the analytics `ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH`).
  - Backend follows the leaderboard pattern: new route modules
    `analytics/worker/{contact,testimonials}.js` + `forms-util.js`, mounted in
    `worker.js`, on a **third D1 db `paddyspeaks-forms`** (binding `FORMS`).
    Separate because it HOLDS PII (the leaderboard db is separate because it
    must hold none).
  - Validation is a single pure module `analytics/lib/forms.js`, imported by the
    Worker and mirrored in `lib/ps-forms.js`. Tests: **138 pass** (was 57).
  - Email = **Resend** (one `fetch()`, no SDK — nothing was configured before).
  - Homepage gained a testimonial strip before the subscribe CTA; footers on
    index/about/resume gained Contact + Testimonials; Interview Studio home has a
    contextual invite at the very end (never inside a practice flow).
  - **Provisioned (2026-07-25).** D1 `paddyspeaks-forms` created
    (`d43111c5-5834-4791-b18d-b892643787c6`), schema applied, `FORMS` binding
    enabled in `wrangler.toml`, Resend domain verified (Sending on, **Receiving
    deliberately off** — it would add root MX records and could hijack existing
    mail to `@paddyspeaks.com`). Remaining: the four Worker Secrets/Vars
    (`RESEND_API_KEY` / `CONTACT_TO_EMAIL` / `CONTACT_FROM_EMAIL` / `FORMS_SALT`)
    and an end-to-end smoke test. Routes return `503 not_configured` whenever
    `env.FORMS` is missing, so they always degrade safely.
  - Gotcha for future edits: a non-UUID `database_id` fails `wrangler deploy` for
    the WHOLE Worker (analytics + leaderboard too) — that is what broke CI on PR
    #736 and why the binding shipped commented out first.
  - **No testimonials are seeded.** Both the homepage and `/testimonials/` show an
    honest "be one of the first" invitation until real ones are approved — same
    principle as the leaderboard's no-seeding rule.
- **NEW (2026-07-24): Analytics redesign — Phase 3 (complete) + Phase 4
  (Journeys & Retention)** on the same branch, restarted from main after #734
  merged. Wired `psTrack()` into simulator/flashcards/study-plan and added
  `question_started`/`answer_submitted`/`explanation_viewed` to the track engine;
  fixed a latent bug (track results are `"wrong"`, code checked `"incorrect"`).
  Added Worker **`GET /api/journeys`** (weekly retention cohorts with null
  incomplete windows + path analysis: landings/exits/transitions/cross-domain)
  and an **anomaly-detection** insight rule (≥2σ daily move). New Journeys tab
  panels in `analytics/index.html`. Tests **57 pass**; dashboard re-verified via
  headless smoke test (all 6 tabs). **All four phases of the redesign are now
  implemented.** Remaining backlog is optional: A/B bucket field, configurable
  alerts UI, deeper per-question skip/abandon analytics once those UI
  affordances exist.
- **NEW (2026-07-24, earlier): Analytics redesign — Phase 2 (decision dashboard)
  + Phase 3 start (Studio events)** on the same branch, restarted from main
  after #733 merged. Added the **6-tab dashboard** (Overview/Acquisition/Content/
  Interview Studio/Journeys/Data Quality) in `analytics/index.html` — existing
  panels preserved and tab-assigned in JS, new decision panels on top;
  **`analytics/lib/insights.js`** deterministic insight engine (pure, tested,
  never fires below sample floor); Worker **`GET /api/insights`** computing
  engaged sessions/medians/correct new-returning/source+content classes/Studio
  funnels/data-quality via the pure libs. Wired **`psTrack()`** into the quiz
  engine (`interview.app/evaluate/js/quiz-engine.js`) and track engine
  (`interview.app/js/track.js`). Tests now **55 pass** (`node
  analytics/tests/run.mjs`); dashboard verified via headless-Chromium smoke test.
  **Still TODO (Phase 3 rest + Phase 4):** wire simulator/flashcards/study-plan/
  study-day events; `question_started`/`hint_requested`/`explanation_viewed`;
  cohort tables + journey/path analysis + Day1/7/30 retention UI; anomaly
  detection. See `docs/analytics/PLAN.md`.
- **Analytics redesign — Phase 1 (Trust & foundations) on
  branch `claude/paddyspeaks-analytics-audit-refpf4`.** Additive + backward-
  compatible; historical `page_views` preserved. Full write-up in
  `docs/analytics/` (AUDIT, PLAN, EVENT-TAXONOMY, METRIC-DICTIONARY,
  DATA-QUALITY-QUERIES, DECISION-GUIDE). Key changes: tracker upgraded to v4
  (`lib/ps.js` — DNT/GPC respect, active engagement time, reliable pagehide
  beacon, scroll milestones, `window.psTrack()` event API); new versioned
  `events`/`visitors` tables + DQ columns (`analytics/worker/migrate-v6-events.sql`);
  Worker gains `POST /api/e` ingest + fixes the exit-UPDATE bug that was silently
  losing time/scroll on D1 (audit finding B). Pure logic in `analytics/lib/*`
  with 44 tests (`node analytics/tests/run.mjs`). **Deploy order:** merge PR
  (auto-deploys Worker + ships tracker), THEN paste migrate-v6 into the D1
  Console. `/api/e` no-ops safely until the migration is applied. Dead
  `analytics/tracker.js` removed. Phases 2–4 (6-tab dashboard, Studio event
  instrumentation, cohorts/journeys) are specified in `docs/analytics/PLAN.md`,
  NOT yet built — do them next, in order.
- **NEW (2026-07-23): Two learning tracks shipped — Communication and AI
  Engineering.** Both are branch `claude/interview-studio-learning-tracks-w17fey`.
  - Content is authored in re-runnable builders: `scripts/build_communication.py`
    (119 exercises, 13 modules — incl. a "Global Workplace Language" module
    decoding corporate jargon, sports metaphors and regional English) and
    `scripts/build_ai.py` (152 questions, 20
    modules). They emit `interview.app/evaluate/data/{communication,ai}.json`
    (same schema as the Skill Check) and `interview/data/questions-ai.json` (the
    Question Bank subset). `build_ai.py` also keeps `interview/data/languages.json`
    + `topics.json` in sync so **AI is a first-class Question Bank category**
    (language chip `ai`, 20 AI type facets).
  - Both tracks appear in **Skill Check** (`evaluate/` — new sections `ai`,
    `communication`), **Flashcards** (same data files), and the **Learn nav hub**
    (`partials/nav.html` → run `build_nav.py`).
  - New interactive **track pages**: `interview.app/communication/` and an added
    "Practise" section on `interview.app/ai-engineering/`, both powered by the
    shared **`js/track.js` + `css/track.css`** engine (module progress, filters
    by topic/level/role/type, bookmarks, mixed/daily practice, continue-where-
    left-off, interview-readiness score — all localStorage, `ps-track-<section>`).
  - Tests: `node interview.app/tests/track-tests.mjs` (dependency-free, 2000+
    checks). To edit content, change the builder and re-run it — never hand-edit
    the generated JSON.
- **Anonymous Community Leaderboard is LIVE** end-to-end (submit, alias, rank,
  delete all working). Backend = Cloudflare Worker + a **separate D1 database**.
- Public board is **hidden by k-anonymity until 5 real scores** exist
  (`suppressBelow: 5`). Until then the page shows a labelled **sample preview**.
- **LinkedIn launch blurb is intentionally parked** until real scores are
  flowing — the user wants organic entries first, no seeding. Write it then.

## Leaderboard — provisioning facts (already done)

- D1 database: **`paddyspeaks-leaderboard`**, id `d49bd1fd-0460-4339-b46d-94f00981a4ad`
  (bound as `LB` in `analytics/worker/wrangler.toml`).
- Schema applied from `analytics/worker/leaderboard-schema.sql`
  (comment-free copy for the D1 dashboard Console:
  `analytics/worker/leaderboard-schema.console.sql`).
- Secret **`LB_SIGNING_KEY`** is set in the Cloudflare dashboard (Worker → Settings
  → Variables and Secrets, type Secret). **Not stored in the repo.** To rotate,
  set a new random value in the same place.
- Deploys are **Git-integrated**: pushing to `main` auto-deploys the Worker
  (the "Workers Builds: paddyspeaks" check + the cloudflare bot on PRs).
- The Worker returns `503 "not configured"` unless BOTH the `LB` binding and
  `LB_SIGNING_KEY` are present — so the board degrades safely.

## Leaderboard — how it works (key files)

- `analytics/worker/leaderboard.js` — routes on `/api/lb/*`. Config in `CFG`:
  `tokenTtlMs 3h`, `minDurationS 10`, `suppressBelow 5`, `retentionMonths 12`,
  `diffMult`, `firstAttemptMult`. Aliases via `makeAlias()` (ADJ×NOUN×#NNN, CSPRNG).
  HMAC single-use attempt tokens; server measures duration; integrity states
  (valid/suspicious/under_review); k-anon suppression; per-entry deletion-token hash.
- `analytics/worker/worker.js` — mounts `routeLeaderboard()`; CORS allows
  `GET, POST, DELETE, OPTIONS` (DELETE was added to fix entry deletion).
- `interview.app/js/lb-client.js` — browser client. Deletion tokens live ONLY in
  `localStorage` (`ps-lb-entries`); sent nowhere except to delete your own entry.
- `interview.app/leaderboard/index.html` + `leaderboard.js` — the board page
  (tabs, states, sample preview, "your entries" + delete, "how your alias works").
- `interview.app/evaluate/js/quiz-engine.js` — issues the attempt token at quiz
  start; renders the consent-gated opt-in on the results screen. Guarded: no card
  appears if the backend is dormant. Only SQL/Python sections map to a category.
- `analytics/worker/LEADERBOARD_DEPLOY.md` — full deploy + rollback checklist.

## Open / deferred items (nothing blocking)

- **▶ IN PROGRESS — Interview Studio "Polish Sprint" (execute, do not re-plan).**
  Running on branch **`claude/weekly-action-plan-kjgt5b`** (the session was
  pinned to that branch, not the `claude/interview-studio-polish-zhfaet` the
  plan named; same work, different branch name). Polish only, **no feature
  creep**.
  - **Mon 2026-07-27 — PS-01, PS-09, PS-11 all DONE and committed.** Notes that
    matter for the rest of the week:
    - PS-01 was bigger than "add a stylesheet": the 21 pages consumed **zero**
      `--color-*` tokens, so loading `studio.css` alone would have changed
      nothing in light mode and put a dark background under light-mode tints in
      dark mode. The real fix was **505 hex→token substitutions** (slate ramp →
      ink/muted/light-muted/border/cream/paper, blue accents → gold family).
    - All 21 pages are pinned **`<html data-theme="light">`**. They carry ~100
      bespoke status tints (green "done" cards, red warnings, amber highlights)
      with no dark variant. `style.css` ships no dark rules, so they were
      already light-only in practice — the pin just stops `studio.css`'s
      `prefers-color-scheme` rules from half-applying. **Follow-up (not
      scheduled):** convert those tints to the dark-aware `note/trap/warn`
      tokens, then drop the pin.
    - White card backgrounds were left as `#fff` on purpose — white-on-warm-
      paper is the Studio convention (`studio.css --surface #fff` on
      `--bg #faf8f4`).
    - PS-09 canonical ring, **match this exactly** if you add a focus rule:
      `outline: 3px solid var(--color-gold-dark); outline-offset: 2px;`.
      Greppable invariant — nothing else should match `outline:.*px solid`.
    - PS-11 found two sources of blue beyond the two the ticket named: the
      **nav template's whole light-mode block** (its dark block was already
      warm) and **`css/track.css`'s `--tk-*` palette** (raw slate + teal, which
      is why the Communication / AI Engineering track pages read blue inside an
      otherwise warm page). Both now derive from `--color-*`.
    - Left blue on purpose (categorical colour-coding, not chrome):
      `.chip-vedic/devotional/hymn/ritual`, `.rmc-1..6`, and the SVG diagrams in
      `design/data-modeling.html`.
    - The 29 `design/the-*-problem.html` deep-dives are **not** part of the
      theme fracture — they are a deliberate separate system (`whiteboard.css`,
      Cormorant Garamond / Newsreader / DM Mono). Leave them alone.
  - **Tue 2026-07-28 — PS-04, PS-06 DONE and committed.**
    - PS-04: the six section cards now sit directly under the hero; both config
      panels live in one `<details class="eval-config">` closed by default. Its
      summary shows a live state line (`#ecfg-state`, updated inside the
      existing `refresh()`), which matters because filters persist in
      localStorage — a returning visitor sees a saved refinement without
      opening the panel. Hero lede cut to two sentences; everything it shed was
      already in the "How it works" list.
    - **Gotcha:** `evaluate/index.html` has a bare `<body>` (no `studio-skin`),
      so it gets **no global link colour** — a plain `<a>` renders browser-blue.
      Style any new link explicitly. Same trap on the other bespoke pages.
    - PS-06: both playground toolbars lead with the primary Run; secondary and
      destructive actions moved behind a "⋯ More" menu driven by the new shared
      **`interview.app/js/pg-overflow.js`** (nav dropdown pattern: aria-expanded,
      click-outside, Escape restores focus). Buttons kept their ids, so the
      bindings in `sql.js`/`python.js` were untouched — do the same if you move
      any more.
    - PS-11 finished off in `playground.css` (navy `#243042` schema block → the
      warm `--code-bg`/`--code-fg`, plus two slate values). That file was
      outside Monday's "shared chrome" scope.
    - Pre-existing, NOT ours: `interview/data/enrichments/co_sql_305-0108.html`
      404s on the SQL playground. Reproduces on a clean tree.
  - **Wed 2026-08-08 — PS-05, PS-07, PS-08 DONE.** See the top of this file
    for the detail. Remaining: Thu PS-02, Fri PS-03/PS-13/PS-12/PS-14/PS-10
    + QA.
  Full ranked plan + before/after mockups (artifact):
  https://claude.ai/code/artifact/0a2933e5-e69a-4dfb-a3be-7c1efef534af
  Audit was grounded in real renders (Playwright screenshots) + code. Headline
  findings: (1) **theme fracture** — ~20 nav pages (leaderboard, simulator,
  stories, flashcards, mock, behavioral, career, companies, elevator-pitch,
  incidents, interviewer, mistakes, red-flags, resume, study-plan, submit,
  whats-new, ai-engineering, my-prep …) DON'T load `studio.css`, so they render
  on the legacy cool-blue palette; flagship pages (home, evaluate, sql/python)
  do. (2) playground editors are bare `<textarea>` (no syntax/line numbers).
  (3) loading = text-only `setStatus()`; empty states = one italic line;
  toolbars = 8–11 equal-weight buttons; Skill Check buries Start below config.
  Execution order (Mon→Fri): 
    - Mon: PS-01 unify theme (add studio.css + `body.studio-skin` + Inter to the
      ~20 pages), PS-09 single focus ring (app.css teal `#0e7490` vs studio gold),
      PS-11 purge blue leftovers (`rgba(26,79,138,.08)` card shadow, `#93c5fd`/
      `#1e40af` tag hovers).
    - Tue: PS-04 value-first Skill Check (start-first, collapse company/pool config),
      PS-06 toolbar hierarchy (one primary Run + overflow for Clear/Reset).
    - Wed: PS-05 skeleton/progress loading, PS-08 intentful empty states,
      PS-07 shortcuts + `?` cheatsheet.
    - Thu: PS-02 CodeMirror 6 (vendor locally under `vendor/`, NO runtime CDN;
      keep textarea as no-JS fallback; sql+python+quiz).
    - Fri: PS-03 first-run onboarding, PS-13 mobile pass, PS-12 motion tokens,
      PS-14 prefetch, PS-10 home hero single-CTA. QA + draft PR.
  Guardrails: never regenerate index.html (hand-edit PS-10); nav stays templated;
  quiz/playground stay `data-theme="light"`; ship as draft PR, one commit per ticket.
  Screenshot script used: `interview.app` via `python3 -m http.server` +
  Playwright at `/opt/node22/lib/node_modules/playwright` (chromium at
  `/opt/pw-browsers/chromium-1194/chrome-linux/chrome`).
- **LinkedIn blurb** — write once real scores are coming in (drafts existed in
  chat; drop the "coming soon" framing).
- Optional product tweaks the user declined for now (leaving organic):
  - Lower `suppressBelow` to 3 for launch, then raise later.
  - Guard the opt-in so a 0% / near-empty attempt can't be published.
- Hardening backlog (all additive): IP-hash rate limiting with a daily-rotating
  salt (privacy review first), suspicious-entry quarantine/admin view,
  percentiles/badges, retention cron jobs, owner analytics dashboard.

## Gotchas / house rules (don't relearn these)

- **NEVER regenerate `index.html`** or run any index-generation script — the
  homepage is hand-crafted (see CLAUDE.md).
- **Nav is templated**: edit `interview.app/partials/nav.html`, then run
  `python3 interview.app/build_nav.py`. Do not hand-edit nav inside pages.
- **Playground/quiz pages are light-only** (`data-theme="light"` hardcoded) — a
  fix for an iPad auto-dark bug. Keep them light; WCAG-AA contrast.
- **D1 dashboard Console flattens newlines** — paste the comment-free
  `.console.sql`, not the commented schema.
- **A green local `validate_content.py` does NOT mean CI is green.** The
  Validate Content workflow runs it as
  `validate_content.py --changed <articles the PR touched>`, and `--changed`
  promotes the inline-SVG and `<title>`/`<!doctype>` checks from *warnings* to
  *hard errors* for those files. So a bare local run reporting "✓ content valid
  (N warnings)" can still fail CI: any warning against a file your PR touched
  becomes an error. **Reproduce CI properly** before pushing:
  `python3 .github/scripts/validate_content.py --changed $(git diff --name-only origin/main...HEAD -- 'articles/*.html')`.
  The practical trap is wide-reaching mechanical edits — they touch hundreds of
  articles and drag every latent legacy warning into the strict set at once.
- **Inline SVGs are parsed as XML, so HTML habits break them.** A bare `&`, or
  `&nbsp;` / `&middot;` / any named entity outside `lt gt amp apos quot`, is
  invalid XML even though browsers render it fine. Use `&amp;` and numeric refs
  (`&#160;`, `&#183;`). Note `minidom` reports only the **first** error per SVG,
  so the error count understates the defect count — fix the whole class, don't
  stop at what CI printed. (A bare `&` inside an SVG *comment* is legal; leave
  those alone.)
- After a PR merges, **restart this branch from latest `main`** for the next
  change (branch: `claude/add-pixel-tracking-tag-qcq74j`). If the branch is
  fully merged, `git merge --ff-only origin/main` does this without the
  destructive-action prompt that `git checkout -B` triggers.

## What shipped this session (high level)

Rebrand to "Interview Studio"; nav overhaul (26 flat links → 4 dropdown hubs via
templating); homepage redesign + Community Challenge Board promo; de-essayed
design pages; dark-mode playground fix; mobile playground overflow fix; heuristic
Hint system; JSON load-error fix; SEO long-tail retitle of 27 design pages +
sitemap; and the full anonymous leaderboard (backend + frontend + go-live).
