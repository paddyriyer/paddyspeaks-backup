"""The household half of articles/can-you-really-afford-the-bay-area.html.

Companion to scripts/bay_area_affordability_model.py, which covers the house
itself. This one covers what happens to a family living in it:

    python scripts/bay_area_household_model.py

  * the 2026 tax model (federal, California, payroll)  -> Part IV
  * the annual budget for a family of four             -> Part V
  * what each income level can actually sustain        -> Table 4
  * salary rich vs equity rich                         -> Part VI
  * the "life hits hard" stress test                   -> Part IX
  * years of financial freedom                         -> Part XI

Prints only; it never touches the site. The article's tables are static HTML, so
if you change an assumption here you must edit them by hand to match.

The tax model is a MODEL. It ignores itemised deductions, AMT, capital gains,
state credits beyond the exemption credits, and the very different treatment of
equity compensation. It is right to within a few thousand dollars for a
straightforward W-2 household, which is all the article asks of it.
It is not tax advice.
